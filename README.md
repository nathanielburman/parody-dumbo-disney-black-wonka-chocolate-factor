My parody Black Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.

Hey, if you had the chance to see the New Willy Wonka and the Gay Factory movie from Hollywood
|or|
The unreleased DumboDisney(tm) Movie -Dumbo like Jumbo(tm), 
the New Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory with a bad ass Black dude in it instead that ain't gay?

Why does Disney have a Dumbo trademark filled in 2007 that allows them to do what with: Ivory?

Hey kid? How did you like that Wonka movie? Wanna play with our Wonka Wonkas?

My Wonka is Wonking to wonk you up.

Wonka wonked my Wonka.

You you have any Wonka bars?

Yes I have two Wonka bars.

Can I come pick them up?

Sure.

Wonka Wonka.

A little boy Wonka.

A wonky Wonka boy.

A little Wonka boy from Hollywood.

From the men who brought you an angry Gene Wilder, Johnny “shithead” Depp, and now comes the little boy called Wonka’s Wonka.

The most Wonka thing to ever come out of a gay man’s mouth.

Gay men in Hollywood know how to make movies. Make little boys. Force women to become gay men. While we take over their sexuality.

Are you a homosexual or a heterosexual?

Homosexuals go on that side, heterosexuals go on the other side.

Homosexuality has destroyed a once great empire but something disgusting happened in the 1960s to cause the divergent reality.

Some one had a dream stolen from them.
